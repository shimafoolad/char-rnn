# code description of Minimal character-level language model with a Vanilla Recurrent Neural Network
Reference page: https://gist.github.com/karpathy/d4dee566867f8291f086

# Overview
This is a toy example of Minimal character-level language model with a Vanilla Recurrent Neural Network implemented by Andrej Karpathy. This code merely tries to transfer a fundemental concept of RNN.

The pdf file, **"RNN along with code description.pdf"**, describes the code as step by step.

The txt file, **"input.txt"**, is used as a dataset for trainig the language model. For simpilicity of the steps in the pdf file, this file contains only one word, "hello". You can replace the word with a long text. 

# Dependencies
* install numpy with command "pip install numpy"
